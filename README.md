  You
    ✓ would dance if I asked you to dance
    ✓ would run and never look back
    ✓ would cry if you saw me crying
    ✓ would save my soul tonight

  You
    ✓ would tremble if I touched your lips
    ✓ would laugh (oh please tell me this)
    ✓ would die for the one you love
    ✓ can hold me in your arms tonight

  Hero
    ✓ can be your hero baby
    ✓ can kiss away the pain
    ✓ will stand by you forever
    ✓ you can take its breath away

  You
    ✓ would swear that you'll always be mine
    ✓ would lie, would run and hide

  Hero
    ✓ is in too deep...
    ✓ ...has lost mind
    ✓ doesn't care...
    ✓ ...you're here tonight

  Hero
    ✓ can be your hero baby
    ✓ can kiss away the pain
    ✓ will stand by you forever
    ✓ you can take its breath away

  Hero
    ✓ can be your hero baby
    ✓ can kiss away the pain
    ✓ will stand by you forever
    ✓ you can take its breath away
